# BPMN analyzer

This example uses diagram-js/bpmn-js to implement a front-end for a bpmn-analyzer.

## Building

You need a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) development stack with [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed to build the project.

To install all project dependencies execute

```
npm install
```

Build the application via

```
npm run all
```

You may also spawn a development setup by executing

```
npm run dev
```

Both tasks generate the distribution ready client-side modeler application into the `public` folder.

Serve the application locally or via a web server (nginx, apache, embedded).
